# Decoupled MERN Stack with JWT Auth Template - Back End

This is the back end of a decoupled MERN Stack app that includes JWT Authentication.

When combined with the front end found [here](https://github.com/SEI-Remote/decoupled-mern-jwt-auth-template-front-end), you'll have all you need to build a full stack MERN app!

Use this to go build things! ðŸš€

## To Use This Template

**Replace `<name-of-your-app-here>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the commands below with the name of your app!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SEI-Remote/decoupled-mern-jwt-auth-template-back-end <name-of-your-app-here>-back-end
cd <name-of-your-app-here>-back-end
code .
```

With the project open in VS Code, open a terminal and run:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Here's what your command line output should like after this step (note that the indicator that we are in a git repository is gone!)

Re-initialize a git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Create a repo for this project on GitHub and add that remote to your project with (replacing your-repo-URL-here with the URL of the repo you just created):

```bash
git remote add origin your-repo-URL-here
```

Run `npm i` to fetch the template's dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

touch a `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

Fill it with the following:

```
DATABASE_URL=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLOUDINARY_URL=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace the `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET`, and `CLOUDINARY_URL` with values that you provide.

> ðŸš¨ Place secrets in this `.env` file. The contents of this file WILL NOT be exposed to site visitors.

Delete this `README.md`, then make an initial commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin main
```

Launch the app with:

```bash
nodemon
```
## Project Structure
The project files are organized in a modular structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. Below is an overview of the main directories and their subfolders:
```
 /controllers
  /employee-management
  /field-and-harvest-management
  /inventory-management
  ...

 /models
  /employee-management
  /field-and-harvest-management
  /inventory-management
  ...

 /routes
  /employee-management
  /field-and-harvest-management
  /inventory-management
  ...
```

## Kebab Case Naming Convention
In this project, we adhere to the kebab case naming convention for file and folder names.

 > ðŸš¨ Kebab case is a method where words are all lowercase and separated by hyphens (-). 

 > ðŸš¨ We use it in our project ONLY for file naming
 
 This is often used in URLs and file names for better readability and consistency.
```
-employeeManagement (Camel Case)
-Employee_Management (Snake Case)
-employee-management (Kebab Case)
```

In our project, you'll see that folder and file names follow this pattern, such as employee-management, field-and-harvest-management, and so on.

You're done!
